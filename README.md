wdwattendance
=============

Playing around with some plotting in R based on WDW attendance numbers.

Just making some plots based on the information listed at: http://www.mouseowners.com/forums/showthread.php?p=1041868

I am assuming that the data is good, which may be a bit of *stretch* after doing some initial analysis.
